Anglo vote interactive
======================

This goes with Jonathan Tilove story scheduled for December.

This is a combination of our interactive starter project and [Mother Jones Magazine's U.S. colored map](https://github.com/motherjones/us-color-coded-map).

The data was pulled from [a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1daB0OOX8mxKbQ8uSjnVA5Y6X74ApwLTh19dV22AwzsI/edit#gid=0) called "Anglo vote" in the statcomdata account, but that was unrealiable so I converted it using Mr. Data into JSON at statedata.js. Further updates will need to go there.

CSS changes for the map need to be made in src\css\style_mojo.less
