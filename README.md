White vote interactive
======================

This goes with Jonathan Tilove story scheduled for December.

This is a combination of our interactive starter project and [Mother Jones Magazine's U.S. colored map](https://github.com/motherjones/us-color-coded-map).

The data comes from a Google Spreadsheet called "White vote" in the statcomdata account.

CSS changes for the map need to be made in src\css\style_mojo.less
